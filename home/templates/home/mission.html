            <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
            At JobIn, our mission is to help people find jobs in a way that reflects the fast paced society that
            we live in. Applicants shouldnâ€™t have to fill out multiple forms for every jobs they are applying for
            nor should they have to bring their resume in person. We believe that applying for a job should be as
            easy as swiping right on your smartphone.
