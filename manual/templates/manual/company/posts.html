    <h4>Posts</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5>Who can apply for my post?</h5>
            <p>
                In the 'Post Form' you are allowed to restrict your post to a certain program. If that is the
                case, only students of that program will be able to apply to your post. Otherwise all students
                will be able to apply to your post. (Note: when you receive applications, you will be able to
                filter them by school, major (if you specified a program) or GPA)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>How will I know when there is activity on a post?</h5>
            <p>
                The notification next to the post will indicate the type of activity going on with a post.
                If there is no notification, that means there is no recent activity.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>What happens after I edit a post?</h5>
            <p>
                All the changes made will automatically be updated and shared across the Jobin platform.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>What happens to applications when a post closes?</h5>
            <p>
                All applications are kept for you to keep looking through, but you will not be able to receive
                new applications for that post unless you reactivate it.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>When do I stop receiving new applications?</h5>
            <p>
                You can stop new receiving new applications by closing the post. Otherwise, posts are no longer
                visible by candidates after the application deadline has passed.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Applications</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5>What are expired posts?</h5>
            <p>
                Expired posts serve three purposes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To keep a record of your posts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To give you access to the posts applicants even after the post has expired (Even though
                    you will not receive any new applications for that post, all the ones you haven't discarded
                    will still be accessible)
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you will be hiring for the same position in some time, reactivating an expired post allows
                    you to recreate the same post without having to refill all the forms, just change the deadline,
                    start and end dates and its live.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>What happens after I request a cover letter?</h5>
            <p>
                A notification is sent to the student and you can track the status by the color code for that
                application in the 'Applicants' view. Moreover, you will be notified when you receive a response.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>How do I get in touch with a candidate?</h5>
            <p>
                You can use the platform to request a cover letter to that applicant, for any further communication
                we provide you with the student's email address.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Application Filters</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5>Where can I see the active filter?</h5>
            <p>
                Active filters can be viewed in the 'Current filters' section.
            </p>
        </li>

                    The GPA filter lets you filter the applicants by GPA. The GPA is noted on a scale from 0-4.0
                    as per the American system. (Note: the GPA filter will return all the applicants with a GPA
                    greater than or equal to the value entered)

                <li>

                    <br/>
                    You can also chose to discard all the applications that do not match the filter criteria, but
                    be careful as this action is irreversible. We suggest that you apply the filter first without
                    discarding the applicants; once you are satisfied with the filtered results you can proceed to
                    discarding the other applicants.
